Mentored team members through the migration process and ensured alignment on architectural decisions, component reuse, and performance best practices.

2. CMS Content Migration to AEM via i90
Migrated CAMS-based content to AEM using i90 experience endpoints, working closely with the CMS team to validate client-specific content (e.g., Bob, Caremark).

Provided technical direction and troubleshooting support to team members during API integration and environment testing phases.

3. Member Info Service Migration to i90
Replaced legacy services dependent on caching and containers with i90-backed member info endpoints.

Enabled cleaner and more maintainable data flow, and collaborated with junior developers to help them understand token handling and member validation patterns.
