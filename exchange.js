Managed Production Releases and Deployed Bug-Free Code:
Throughout the year, I played a pivotal role in managing production releases across all key projects. By conducting thorough testing and implementing robust quality control measures, I consistently delivered bug-free code, ensuring reliability and client satisfaction. My proactive management of release cycles minimized downtime and maintained high operational standards.

Client Support for BCBSMA, Aetna, and Molina:
Throughout the year, I provided extensive client support for BCBSMA, Aetna, and Molina to consume client API services. This included resolving queries, addressing questions, and facilitating smooth integrations. These efforts helped strengthen client relationships, improved service adoption, and ensured that client needs were met efficiently and effectively.

Team Leadership as a Tech Lead:
As a Tech Lead, I led the team by facilitating clear communication, ensuring developers fully understood requirements in a timely manner, and providing guidance throughout the project lifecycle.
