We have been facing issues recently related to delays in DevEx support, which are increasingly impacting our deployment workflows. When tickets are raised—especially during critical release windows—they often remain unassigned for some time, delaying resolution and introducing risk to our timelines.

Some common scenarios where these delays become problematic include:

ArgoCD cleanup issues, where old versions are not refreshed properly, requiring manual intervention.

Harness pipeline failures in stages outside our control, needing DevEx support to proceed.

Since DevEx is supporting multiple teams, the current response model often leads to bottlenecks for us during time-sensitive deployments. It might be helpful to explore options for improving prioritization, or having more responsive support during release windows.
